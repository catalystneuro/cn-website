description: "Developed comprehensive NWB conversion tools for the Shenoy lab's diverse motor neuroscience datasets. The conversion pipeline handles multiple experimental paradigms including center-out reaching tasks, Neuropixels recordings in monkeys, and maze navigation tasks. Created analysis and visualization pipelines for examining neural population dynamics during reaching and delay activity in premotor cortex. The tools support both direct streaming from DANDI and local data conversion workflows."
