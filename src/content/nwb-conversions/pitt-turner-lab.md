lab: "Robert Turner"
institution: "University of Pittsburgh"
description: "Developed comprehensive NWB conversion tools for the Turner lab's electrophysiology datasets, focusing on single-unit recordings from multiple brain areas in parkinsonian macaques during reaching tasks. Created a custom NWB extension (ndx-turner-metadata) for storing lab-specific metadata. The conversion pipeline includes specialized extractors and interfaces for TDT recordings, with support for both filtered and raw data streams. The tools handle multi-session experiments and include interactive tutorials for data visualization and analysis."
