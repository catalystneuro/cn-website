description: "Developed comprehensive NWB conversion tools for the Pinto lab's two-photon imaging datasets. The conversion pipeline handles Bruker Ultima microscope data, Suite2P segmentation outputs, and holographic stimulation experiments. Created a custom NWB extension (ndx-pinto-metadata) for storing ViRMEN experimental metadata, and the tools support both command-line and interactive notebook-based workflows for data conversion and analysis."
