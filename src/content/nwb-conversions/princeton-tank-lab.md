description: "Developed comprehensive NWB conversion tools for the Tank lab's behavioral and electrophysiology datasets. Created a custom NWB extension (ndx-tank-metadata) for storing experiment-specific metadata including maze configurations and rig parameters. The conversion pipeline integrates Neuropixels recordings with VirMen behavioral data, including detailed trial structure, behavioral metrics, and synchronized TTL events. The tools support extensive metadata handling and include specialized visualization widgets for behavioral analysis."
