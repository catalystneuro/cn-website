lab: "Tony Movshon"
institution: "New York University"
description: "Developed comprehensive NWB conversion tools for the Movshon lab's diverse electrophysiology and visual neuroscience datasets. The conversion pipeline handles multiple data formats including Blackrock, OpenEphys, and SpikeGLX recordings, with integrated spike sorting through SpikeInterface. The tools support both command-line and graphical user interface workflows, enabling efficient processing of complex visual neuroscience experiments. The project facilitates the standardization of the lab's extensive visual cortex recordings, supporting their research into neural mechanisms of visual perception and motion processing."
