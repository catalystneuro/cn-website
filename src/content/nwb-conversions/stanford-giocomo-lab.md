description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Giocomo lab's spatial navigation datasets, including tetrode and Neuropixel recordings from medial entorhinal cortex, and two-photon calcium imaging from hippocampal CA1. The conversion pipeline handles multi-modal data including neural recordings, virtual reality behavior, and head motion measurements."
