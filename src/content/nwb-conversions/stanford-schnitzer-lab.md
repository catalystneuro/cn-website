description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Schnitzer lab's in vivo calcium imaging datasets. The conversion pipeline handles data from miniaturized microscopes (miniscopes) and fiber photometry recordings, including behavioral measurements during freely moving animal experiments. The tools support both one-photon and two-photon calcium imaging data, with specialized interfaces for motion correction and cell segmentation outputs."
