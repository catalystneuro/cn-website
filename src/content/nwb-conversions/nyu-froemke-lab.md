description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Froemke lab's neurophysiology datasets studying auditory cortex plasticity and maternal behavior. The conversion pipeline handles complex data including neural recordings during vocalization processing, behavioral measurements, and oxytocin system manipulations, capturing both intrinsic and experience-dependent plasticity mechanisms."
