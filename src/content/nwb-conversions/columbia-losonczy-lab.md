description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Losonczy lab's two-photon calcium imaging datasets. The conversion pipeline handles data from head-fixed mice running on voluntary treadmills, including raw ROI images, DfOverF traces, fluorescence traces, and behavioral measurements. The tools support molecular identification of interneuron subtypes and integrate position tracking with neural activity data."
