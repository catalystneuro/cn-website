description: "Developed NWB conversion tools and utilities for the Allen Institute's Neuropixels datasets. The project includes tools for handling simultaneous Neuropixels probe recordings and EEG data, along with cortical electrical stimulation in head-fixed mice. The conversion pipeline supports complex multi-modal experiments investigating brain states and cortico-thalamic interactions across different behavioral conditions."
