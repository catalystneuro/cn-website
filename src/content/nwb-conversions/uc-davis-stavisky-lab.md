description: "Developed comprehensive NWB conversion tools for the Stavisky lab's brain-to-text decoding datasets. The conversion pipeline handles complex neural decoding data including RNN decoder outputs, language model predictions, and processed electrophysiology signals. Created custom visualization widgets for analyzing decoding performance, trial-aligned data, and temporal evolution of phoneme and word predictions. The tools support Redis-based data streaming and include extensive configuration options through YAML files."
