description: "Developed NWB conversion tools for the Leifer lab's C. elegans neural imaging datasets. The conversion pipeline handles complex whole-brain calcium imaging data combined with optogenetic stimulation, supporting systematic mapping of neural signal propagation across thousands of neuron pairs in the worm nervous system."
