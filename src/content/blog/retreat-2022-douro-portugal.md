After months of Zoom calls and virtual collaboration during the global lockdown, our CatalystNeuro team finally gathered in person for an unforgettable retreat in Portugal's stunning Douro Valley. As the team assembled from various countries, we took the opportunity to explore Porto, Portugal.

The historic wine region, with its terraced vineyards and winding river, provided the perfect backdrop for strengthening team bonds and mapping out our company's future.

## A Historic Setting for a Historic Moment

Our home base for the week was the magnificent Casa do Monte, a centuries-old restored farmhouse nestled in the heart of the Lower Corgo region.

## More Than Just a Business Retreat

While our days were filled with productive strategy sessions and project planning, this retreat was about much more than work. For many team members, it was their first time meeting colleagues in person after years of remote collaboration. The joy of finally putting faces to Zoom squares and sharing meals together cannot be overstated.

Our schedule balanced focused work sessions with time to experience local culture. Mornings were dedicated to strategic planning and project reviews, while afternoons and evenings allowed us to explore the region's rich heritage. A highlight was our walking tour through a nearby village, where we learned about local wine production – complete with tastings that gave us a literal flavor of the area's traditions.

## Building the Future of Neuroscience Software

The retreat provided invaluable face-to-face time to discuss our ongoing projects and future directions. We dove deep into our work on NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) and DANDI, exploring ways to better serve the neuroscience community. The relaxed setting sparked creative discussions about improving our tools like SpikeInterface, VAME, and neurosift, with impromptu whiteboard sessions happening between dips in the pool.

## Cultural Immersion

Being in Portugal wasn't just about the location – we embraced the culture wholeheartedly. From enjoying traditional Portuguese dinners at the villa to practicing our newly learned Portuguese phrases with locals, the team fully immersed themselves in the experience. The Douro Valley's UNESCO World Heritage status reminded us daily of the importance of preserving and building upon valuable legacy systems – a philosophy that resonates deeply with our work in neuroscience data standardization.

## Looking Forward

As we returned to our respective corners of the world, we carried with us not just updated project plans and strategies, but stronger personal connections and renewed enthusiasm for our mission. The Portugal retreat marked a significant milestone in CatalystNeuro's journey, setting the stage for even greater collaboration and innovation in neuroscience software development.


This gathering in the Douro Valley wasn't just our first post-lockdown retreat – it was a celebration of resilience, teamwork, and the power of in-person connection. As we continue to grow and evolve as a company, we'll always look back on these few days in Portugal as a pivotal moment that strengthened our team and sharpened our vision for the future of neuroscience data management.
