## Cultural Experiences

### A Special Culinary Lesson
One of the most memorable highlights of our retreat was an intimate cooking session where Alessandra shared her family's treasured lasagna recipe. The kitchen came alive with stories of Italian culinary traditions as we learned the precise techniques and secret ingredients that make this generational recipe so special. This hands-on experience not only resulted in a delicious meal but also gave us a genuine taste of Italian family culture.
