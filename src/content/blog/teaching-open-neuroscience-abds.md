# Teaching Open Neuroscience at the African Brain Data Science Academy

Last month, I had the privilege of participating as an instructor at the African Brain Data Science (ABDS) Academy, an innovative initiative sponsored by the Kavli Foundation. This groundbreaking program, organized by Damian Eke and Eberechi Wogu from the African Brain Data Network (ABDN), brought together talented African researchers in data science and neuroscience to explore cutting-edge open data practices and analysis techniques.

## Bridging the Gap in Neuroscience Data Science

The ABDS Academy serves a crucial role in democratizing access to modern neuroscience tools and methodologies. A highlight of the program was the comprehensive coverage of neuroimaging platforms and tools, led by experts in their respective fields. Franco Pestili guided the BrainLife sessions along with team members Anibal Heinsfeld and Sihang (Suna) Guo, while James Kent conducted engaging workshops on NeuroSynth. Participants received hands-on training in discovering and analyzing open neuroimaging datasets across these platforms.

## Hands-on Data Discovery and Analysis

A significant portion of our sessions focused on practical skills for working with open datasets. Participants learned how to effectively navigate neurophysiology archives to find relevant data for their research questions. We walked through the process of searching data repositories, understanding dataset metadata, and identifying suitable datasets for analysis. Using tools like Neurosift, researchers gained hands-on experience in visualizing and analyzing neurophysiology data directly from the archives. This practical approach ensured that participants left with not just theoretical knowledge, but the actual skills needed to work with open datasets in their research.

## Educational Sessions and Resources

As part of the program, I contributed by leading two main sessions. The first focused on Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) and DANDI, where I introduced participants to these essential tools for standardizing and sharing neurophysiology data, demonstrating how they're revolutionizing data collaboration in neuroscience research.

The second session centered on open educational resources in computational neuroscience. I shared information about programs like Neuromatch Academy and NeuroHackademy, as well as popular MOOC platforms including Coursera, EdX, and MIT OpenCourseWare. These resources provide invaluable opportunities for continued learning and development in computational neuroscience.

## Cross-Platform Synergies

One of the most exciting aspects of the Academy was discovering the natural synergies between different neuroscience tooling ecosystems. The combination of BrainLife's neuroimaging capabilities, NeuroSynth's meta-analysis tools, and NWB's data standardization framework revealed powerful opportunities for integrated workflows. These connections highlighted how researchers can leverage multiple platforms to create more comprehensive and robust analysis pipelines.

## The Perfect Learning Environment at Brackenhurst

The success of the Academy was greatly enhanced by its location at Brackenhurst, a beautiful retreat center in Kenya. The serene setting provided the ideal environment for focused learning and collaboration. The well-equipped classroom facilities supported our technical sessions, while the comfortable accommodations and provided meals allowed participants to fully immerse themselves in the learning experience without external distractions.

The spacious grounds and communal areas fostered natural networking opportunities, enabling instructors and attendees to continue discussions beyond the formal sessions. These informal interactions proved invaluable for building lasting connections within the African neuroscience community. The peaceful atmosphere of Brackenhurst, combined with its excellent facilities, created an environment where both teaching and learning could flourish.

Brackenhurst was home also to some impressive Kenyan wildlife, including monkeys!

## Safari Adventure at Nairobi National Park

One of the highlights of our time together was a memorable safari trip to Nairobi National Park, generously organized by one of the instructors, Silke Anders. The entire school had the incredible opportunity to experience Kenya's magnificent wildlife firsthand. We were fortunate to observe a diverse array of animals in their natural habitat, including majestic giraffes, powerful lions, endangered rhinoceros, and striking zebras. This shared adventure not only provided a welcome break from our intensive academic sessions but also fostered stronger bonds between ABDS students and instructors.

## Impact and Future Directions

The ABDS Academy represents a significant step forward in building capacity for neuroscience research in Africa. By providing access to modern tools and platforms for data analysis and sharing, we're helping to ensure that African researchers can fully participate in and contribute to the global neuroscience community.

This initiative aligns perfectly with the growing movement toward open science and data sharing in neuroscience. Through programs like ABDS, we're not just teaching technical skills â€“ we're fostering a community of researchers who can collaborate effectively across borders and contribute to the advancement of neuroscience research worldwide.
