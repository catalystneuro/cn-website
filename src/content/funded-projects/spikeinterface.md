The Simons Foundation supports the development of SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting analysis. This project focuses on creating and maintaining tools that enable neuroscientists to analyze and process electrophysiological recordings more effectively. SpikeInterface provides a standardized way to run, compare, and benchmark various spike sorting algorithms, making it easier for researchers to process and analyze their neural data.
