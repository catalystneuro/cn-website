description: "Development of Voluseg for volumetric segmentation of calcium imaging data"
---

Led by Luiz Tauffer in collaboration with Dr. Mika Rubinov's laboratory at Vanderbilt University, we are developing Voluseg, a specialized tool for volumetric segmentation of calcium imaging data. This project focuses on creating advanced algorithms and tools that enable neuroscientists to efficiently process and analyze three-dimensional calcium imaging datasets, facilitating the study of neural activity patterns in complex brain structures.
